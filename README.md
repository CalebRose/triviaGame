Assignment 5 from University of Texas at Austin Bootcamp

## Concept
Design a Trivia Game which prompts the user with a question. Provide a time limit for each question. Once the user has gone through all trivia questions, provide the user with results based on their performance. Allow the user to retry the trivia game if they wish to.

## Features
- Multiple Choice Questions
- Timer set for each question
- American Western Theme

## Needed improvements
- Fix background page from .jpg to .png. The background is loading too slow for GitHub.
